    "text": "2.9 Removing elements\nWe can customize our plot even further by adding a theme() function to the end of our plot. We’ll use this to remove individual elements from the plot.\nNote: If we change any theme attributes after calling theme_minimal(), it will basically overwrite the previous built-in theme. This means that order is important, so keep that in mind!\ntheme() looks very intimidating, because it has lots of different arguments. We’ll only look at a few of these:\n\naxis.title, axis.title.x and axis.title.y (The labels for the axes)\npanel.grid (grid lines)\nlegend.position (Placing the legend, including removing it)\n\nHow will we remove these elements? For most of them, we will specify an element called element_blank() to these arguments. What is this? Think of it as a special placeholder that says we don’t want to see this element.",
